#' Ensemble batch prediction intervals and prediction metrics
#' 
#' @param X_train A data frame of training data.
#' @param y_train A vector of training data.
#' @param model The model to use for nowcasting.
#' @param formula A formula object.
#' @param params The parameters to use for the model.
#' @param k The number of steps ahead to predict. If NULL, the number of steps is determined by the amount of data to be nowcast.
#' @param batches The number of batches to use for training (akin to the number of folds for k-fold cross validation).
#' @param train_window The number of days to use for training. Defaults to 60% of the training data, which allows for a large training set for each batch while also allowing for a reasonable amount of variation in the test sets.
#' @param level The prediction interval level.
#'
#' @returns A dadnow object with the ensemble predictions and intervals added.
