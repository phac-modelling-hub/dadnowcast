#' Nowcast various models from a prepared data frame
#'
#' @param formula A formula, e.g. y ~ x, y ~ lag(x1, 1) + lag(x2, 3)
#' @param data A data frame. Must contain the variables specified in the formula and in `date_col`. Trailing NA values in `y` will be nowcasted.
#' @param model The model to use for nowcasting. See `vignette("Model_Details", package = "fatherStay")` and `vignette("Mechanistic_Model", package = "fatherStay")` for more information about currently implemented models, and `vignette("Write_fit_XX_functions", package = "fatherStay")` for how to write your own model for use in this package.
#' @param batches The number of batches to use for training in the EnbPI calculation (akin to the number of folds for k-fold cross validation).
#' @param train_window The number of days to use for training. Defaults to 60% of the training data, which allows for a large training set for each batch while also allowing for a reasonable amount of variation in the test sets.
#' @param level The prediction interval level.
#' @param params The parameters to use for the model. Must be a named list.
#' @param date_col Name of the column containing date information. If NULL, the date information attempted to be inferred. If there's a single datetime column then it is used. If the data are a ts or mts or zoo object, the dates are esxtracted.
#'
#' @details
#' A short overview of the specific models used here is given below, more details can be found in the vignette `Model_Details`.
#' - "lm", a standard linear model, which takes no additional parameters.
#' - "ar", an autoregressive model, it has the parameter `p` which is the degree of the AR model.
#' - "arx", an autoregressive model with exogenous variables, it is an AR model that adds the capacity to consider explanatory variables, it has the same parameters as an ar model.
#' - "arima", an ARIMA model combines an AR model with a moving average (MA) model, it has parameters `p`, which specifies the degree of the AR component, `d` which specifies the degree of differencing in the model, and `q` which is the degree of the moving average model.
#' - "gam", a generalized additive model, it has parameters `family` to specify the family used, `smooths` which is smoothing parameters for each variable, and `bs` which specifies basis smoothing functions.
#' - "kf", a Kalman filter model, which is a continuously updating model with a prediction and update portion, it takes additional parameters `degree` which specifies the degree of the trend, and `CovMatrix` which is a covariance matrix for the disturbance terms.
#' - "rf", a random forest model, a tree based model that grows many trees and combines the output to pick a prediction, it takes parameters `ntree` the number of trees to grow, `mtry` the number of variables used as candidates at each split, `weights` weights the sample data, `replace` should sampling be done with or without replacement, `maxnodes` limits the number of terminal nodes, `nodesize` sets the minimum size of the terminal nodes.
#' - "xgboost", a extreme gradient boosting model, which is a tree based model in which subsequent trees learn from previous trees, it takes parameters `nrounds` which is the number of boosting iteration to do, and `XGBparams` a list of more parameters used in the model the most important of which is `max_depth` both `nrounds` and `max_depth` are tuned if their values are not specified, it also takes `verbose` should output be silent (0) or not (1).
#' - "mechanistic", creates a mechanistic model, `sc`, `sp`, and `method` specifies the family.
#' - See `vignette("Write_fit_XX_functions", package = "fatherStay")` for how to write your own model for use in this package.
